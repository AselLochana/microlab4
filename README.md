Waterlevel sensor using the PIC16F877A microcontroller 

## Introduction
We are constructing a waterlevel sensor using the PIC16F877A microcontroller and to demonstrate the logic behind the system we are using analogue thermal sensors as the switches interfaced with the system and LEDS as the output to detect the relavant logic levels. The truth table behind the programme used is shown below
